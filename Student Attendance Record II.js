// 552. Student Attendance Record II

// Topics

// Companies

// Hard

// An attendance record for a student can be represented as a string where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:

// 'A': Absent.

// 'L': Late.

// 'p': Present.

// Any student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the following criteria:

// The student was absent ('A') for strictly fewer than 2 days total.

// The student was never late ('L') for 3 or more consecutive days.

// Given an integer n, return the number of possible attendance records of length n that make a student eligible for an attendance award. The answer may be very large, so return it modulo 10ยบ + 7.
